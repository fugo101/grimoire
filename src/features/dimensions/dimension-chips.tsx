/**
 * One row of tappable chips, one per option. This is how both dimensions are
 * chosen everywhere: the filter rows on the dashboard and the public report,
 * and the two required pickers on the transaction form.
 *
 * Every choice is visible at once and picking one is a single tap — no
 * open-choose-close cycle, no hidden state. That is the whole reason #131
 * exists: the person this tracker is for should not have to open a dialog,
 * scroll a list and close it again to make one choice.
 *
 * Two modes, one prop apart. A **filter** leads with an explicit "everything"
 * chip and `null` means "not narrowed". A **required** choice has no such
 * chip, `null` means "not yet answered", and nothing is pressed until the
 * user answers — so an unanswered field looks unanswered, which is the same
 * property the select this replaces had to be taught (`data-placeholder`).
 *
 * Behaviour carried over from that select, each paid for by a bug:
 *
 * - **A labelled group, not bare buttons.** The question is a visible label
 *   and the group points at it with `aria-labelledby`, so a screen reader
 *   announces "Tiền dùng để làm gì?, group" rather than a run of loose
 *   buttons whose relationship is only visual.
 * - **A stale value must not read as "everything".** When `value` names no
 *   option — an id left in a URL after a rename or a delete — the
 *   "everything" chip is *not* pressed; a pressed chip reading `unknown`
 *   stands in its place, so the reader can see a filter is active and clear
 *   it. Without this, a filter matching zero rows would look identical to no
 *   filter at all.
 * - **A 48px target on a phone.** The public report's select once lost its
 *   height in a port because the class went to a wrapper. Here the size is
 *   `toggleVariants`' `touch`, set on the group and inherited by every chip.
 *
 * Built on the toggle group rather than plain buttons: it gives arrow-key
 * movement between chips and the pressed state for free, and "at most one
 * pressed" is what a single-select toggle group is for.
