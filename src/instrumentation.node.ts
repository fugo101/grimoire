/**
 * Close SQLite on shutdown.
 *
 * `node server.js` (the standalone output's own entry, see PR 10) is PID 1 in
 * the container, so SIGTERM from `docker stop` lands here directly — nothing
 * else installs a handler for it. better-sqlite3 is synchronous and SQLite's
 * default `synchronous=FULL` fsyncs each commit into the WAL, which is
 * replayed on the next open, so nothing committed is at risk either way. What
 * closing buys is a checkpointed, truncated WAL and a clean open next boot
 * instead of a recovery pass.
 *
 * `process.on("exit", ...)` rather than doing the close directly in the
 * SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers: `exit` always fires and `close()` is synchronous,
 * so it's legal there, and it doesn't risk racing whatever handler Next's own
 * server installs for the signals themselves. The signal handlers below just
 * convert the signal into an `exit`, since Node does not exit on SIGTERM/
 * SIGINT by default once any listener is attached to them.
