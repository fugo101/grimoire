 * `isLoading` used to be optional, falling back to useFormStatus() from

 * and the one form relying on it was the logout form, which is now a mutation.
 * Every other call site already passed the flag explicitly.
 *
 * Props are forwarded rather than enumerated: the previous signature accepted
 * only five, so a caller needing `disabled`, `onClick`, `form` or `aria-*` had
 * to reach past this component entirely.
