   * #138 and reproduced in a headless browser (9 rendered at top, middle and
   * bottom; with this directive, 22 in the middle and 25 at the bottom,
   * reaching the last index).
   *
   * The desktop table does not need this: `useVirtualizer` is on the
   * compiler's known-incompatible list, so that component is skipped
   * automatically — which is also why `react-hooks/incompatible-library`
   * fires there. `useWindowVirtualizer` is not on the list, so the compiler
   * compiles this one and has to be told not to.
