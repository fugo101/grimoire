/**
 * Port of `__root.tsx`. Reading `cookies()` here (for theme, same as
 * `theme.functions.ts`'s `getCookie` today) opts the whole tree out of static
 * generation — see plan hazard 3: without a per-request read somewhere in the
 * root, `/login` and the `/dashboard/manage/*` screens have no per-request
 * input at the page level and Next could prerender them once at build time,
 * baking one admin's data into a static shell served forever.
 *
 * `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` below is not redundant with that
 * read. `next build`'s static-generation attempt renders a page's own async
 * Server Component concurrently with its ancestor layouts rather than
 * strictly after them, so a page that calls a `lib/db/queries.ts`/
 * `server/*.queries.ts` function directly (PR 7 onward — the whole point of
 * the self-fetch-avoidance rule in `query-options.ts`) can open `data.db`
 * before this layout's `cookies()` call ever gets a chance to bail the
 * render out. `force-dynamic` is checked per route segment before any
 * component body runs at all, cascades to every nested layout/page, and
 * closes that gap for good — confirmed by tracing an actual `next build`
 * that reproduced the leak without it.
