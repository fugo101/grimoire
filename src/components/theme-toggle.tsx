/**
 * Three explicit states rather than a two-way switch, because "system" is the
 * default and a switch cannot express it — a user on a dark phone would have no
 * way back to "follow my phone" once they touched it.
 *
 * `themePreference` is passed in rather than read from context: the root
 * layout reads the theme cookie via `cookies()` and passes it down as a plain
 * prop, since the App Router has no route-context equivalent to hand it to
 * every caller directly.
 *
 * The server-rendered preference seeds local state; after that this component
 * owns it, since `persistTheme` writes the cookie and toggles the class
 * directly. Nothing is invalidated and no request is made, so switching is
 * instant.
