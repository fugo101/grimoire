# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Grimoire is a self-hosted expense tracker with Vietnamese UI and VND currency. Single-admin JWT auth, SQLite storage, mobile-first responsive design.

Every transaction is described by two **independent** dimensions: a **Purpose** (what the money was for) and a **Funding Source** (which pot it came from). They are flat sets with no hierarchy, and knowing one tells you nothing about the other. The vocabulary is not negotiable and the word "category" is retired — see `CONTEXT.md` for the glossary and `docs/adr/0001-two-dimensions-instead-of-a-category-tree.md` for why the tree that used to encode both at once had to go.

## Library priority

When something new is needed, pick in this order — whichever is named first wins:

1. **TanStack first** — Query, Table, Form, Virtual, Store, Pacer.
2. **shadcn first** — if TanStack has no answer, take the component from shadcn (the `base-nova` registry, built on Base UI).
3. **Tailwind first** — if neither does, build it with Tailwind utilities rather than pulling in another CSS or UI library.

Only reach outside those three when none of them has a solution, and record why in the PR description.

Accepted exceptions: **recharts** (what shadcn's chart is built on — TanStack has no charting library), **vaul** (what shadcn's drawer is built on — Base UI has no drawer), **next-intl** (none of the three does i18n, and ICU plurals/interpolation are what a hand-rolled catalog would reimplement badly), plus `jose`, `drizzle-orm`, `better-sqlite3`, `zod` and `server-only`.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pnpm run dev` | Start dev server |
| `pnpm run build` | Production build → `.next/standalone` |
| `pnpm run start` | Serve the production build |
| `pnpm run lint` | ESLint check |
| `pnpm run lint:fix` | ESLint auto-fix |
| `pnpm run format` | Prettier format |
| `pnpm run format:check` | Prettier check (runs in CI) |
| `pnpm run test` | Vitest, single run (runs in CI) |
| `pnpm run test:watch` | Vitest in watch mode |
| `pnpm run db:push` | Push Drizzle schema to SQLite (local iteration only) |
| `pnpm run db:generate` | Generate a versioned migration from schema changes |
| `pnpm run db:studio` | Open Drizzle Studio for DB inspection |

Tests run on Vitest (`pnpm run test`). They drive real SQLite files rather than mocking the database, and the one test that seeds from the gitignored production snapshot self-skips where that file is absent. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, `format:check`, type-check, the test suite, `pnpm audit`, and build on a self-hosted Linux runner. Fork PRs are blocked from CI. The runner is a small, swap-less box, so `ci.yml` sets `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX`/`NODE_OPTIONS` at the job level as a standing memory mitigation — don't remove them without knowing why (a real CI OOM incident is what put them there).

Those checks prove the code compiles, is formatted, and passes the tests that happen to exist — the suite is thin and covers nothing like every path. **Behaviour has to be verified by running it**, and a check that something is now rejected means little on its own: pair it with a control that must still pass, or a broken build looks identical to a working guard. Migrations especially need exercising against a copy of a real `data.db`, not just a fresh one — the fresh path is the one that cannot break.

Node version is pinned to 26 by `.nvmrc`, and CI plus the Docker image match it.

**TypeScript runs side-by-side (TS 7 + TS 6).** `tsc` is TypeScript 7 (the Go compiler), installed as `"@typescript/native": "npm:typescript@^7"`; the `typescript` specifier is aliased to `@typescript/typescript6`, which is what still ships a JS compiler API. typescript-eslint cannot use TS 7 until TS ships a new API (7.1) — [typescript-eslint#10940](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/10940) is open and locked — so the lint layer resolves `typescript` and gets TS 6. Consequences: `pnpm run typecheck` is TS 7, `pnpm run lint` and Next's own type step are TS 6, and `experimental.useTypeScriptCli: false` in `next.config.ts` is load-bearing (Next 16.3 otherwise looks for `typescript/bin/tsc`, which the TS 6 alias package does not ship — it has `bin/tsc6`). Collapse this back to a single `typescript` dependency once typescript-eslint supports TS 7.

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local  # set ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_PASSWORD, AUTH_SECRET (32+ chars), DATABASE_URL
pnpm run dev  # migrations apply automatically on startup (src/instrumentation.node.ts)
```

## Architecture

**Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router) · next-intl · TanStack Query · TanStack Table · TanStack Form · TanStack Virtual · React 19 · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS 4 · Base UI (shadcn) · Drizzle ORM · SQLite · jose (JWT)

### Layers

- **App Router** (`src/app/`) — Root layout at `src/app/layout.tsx` reads the theme cookie once via `cookies()` and forces `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` (load-bearing — see below). Protected pages live under `src/app/dashboard/**`, guarded by `readSession()` in `dashboard/layout.tsx`; `src/app/login/` and the public shared report at `src/app/p/[code]/` (its own segment-scoped `not-found.tsx`/`error.tsx`, deliberately **no** `loading.tsx` — see below). Every `page.tsx`/`layout.tsx` does exactly three things: parse `searchParams`/read `cookies()`, prefetch into a per-request `QueryClient`, and render exactly one `"use client"` view wrapped in `<HydrationBoundary>` — it never imports `components/ui/*` or a feature component directly.
- **Server layer** (`src/server/`) — Mutations live in `*.actions.ts` (`"use server"`, 16 total), returning `{ success, error? }` (`ActionState`) for business-rule failures — `error` is a catalog key plus values (`{ key, values? }`), never prose; the client translates it with `useErrorMessage()` (ADR-0004). Reads split two ways: Route Handlers (`src/app/api/*/route.ts`) back client-side `fetchJson` calls from `src/lib/api.ts`; plain functions in `*.queries.ts`/`src/lib/db/queries.ts` are what RSC pages call **directly** during prefetch — never their own Route Handler, which would be a self-fetch from the server back to itself. A third tier, `*.server.ts` (`dimensions.server.ts`, `share-links.server.ts`), holds shared Drizzle predicates called from the actions/queries above it — despite the name, these are live business logic, not a TanStack leftover. `dimensions.server.ts` is where the create/rename/delete mechanism both dimensions share lives, including the rule that neither can be deleted while transactions point at it; `purposes.actions.ts` and `funding-sources.actions.ts` are thin wrappers over it, separate so the two dimensions keep separate public surfaces.
- **Query options** (`src/lib/query-options.ts`) — `queryOptions()` factories. The query keys double as the invalidation map. Their `queryFn`s call `fetchJson` against `app/api/*` — client-side only; RSC prefetch bypasses this entirely (see above).
- **Queries** (`src/lib/db/queries.ts`) — Read-only Drizzle access. Server functions wrap these; the module is server-only.
- **Schema** (`src/lib/db/schema.ts`) — Drizzle table definitions: `purposes` and `fundingSources` (both flat — **no parent column, deliberately**), `transactions` (a required FK to each), `shareLinks`, and the `shareLinkPurposes` junction. Uses UUIDv7 for IDs, nanoid(12) for auto-generated share-link codes. Names carry no unique index; the reason differs per table and is documented on the schema itself.
- **Validation** (`src/lib/schemas.ts`) — Zod schemas, shared between TanStack Form and both Server Actions' and Route Handlers' own re-validation of input. Their messages are catalog keys written through `msg()`, translated by `<FieldError>`; a constraint a user can trip without a key reads as the generic `validation.invalid` (ADR-0004).
- **Features** (`src/features/`) — Feature-scoped components: `transactions/` (form, `columns.tsx` + `transaction-data-table.tsx` on TanStack Table/Virtual, filters, `expense-chart.tsx` on Recharts), `dimensions/`, `share-links/`, `overview/`, `public-report/`. `dimensions/` serves **both** Purposes and Funding Sources from one set of components: the mechanism is shared so the two cannot drift into behaving differently, while every user-facing word lives in that dimension's own catalog subtree (`dimensions.purpose` / `dimensions.fundingSource`, picked by `namespace` in `dimension-copy.ts`) so they stay plainly distinct on screen — a type assertion there fails the build if the two subtrees' keys drift apart.
- **Components** (`src/components/`) — Reusable UI primitives in `ui/` (shadcn/Base UI). App-level shared components at root: `ResponsiveModal` (dialog on desktop, drawer on mobile), `CurrencyInput` (VND formatting), `SubmitButton`, `ConfirmDialog`, `PendingIndicator`, `FieldError` (a form field's first error, translated from its catalog key).

### Data flow

A server `page.tsx` calls the plain query function directly and seeds the cache via `queryClient.setQueryData(xQueryOptions(...).queryKey, await getX(...))` — never `ensureQueryData`/`prefetchQuery`, which would trigger the self-fetch described above. The paired client view then reads the same query back with `useSuspenseQuery`, so SSR renders real data and hydration reuses it.

**Filter/month changes go through `router.push(url, { scroll: false })` wrapped in `useTransition`**, since the App Router has no shallow-routing primitive that also re-renders the server tree. `useDelayedPending` (`src/hooks/use-delayed-pending.ts`) replicates the old `defaultPendingMs: 200`. `src/lib/search-params.ts` is where each route's URL contract is written down once: a `page.tsx` parses `searchParams` there and hands the result to its client view, which builds both its query key and its hrefs from it — three places one parameter name could otherwise be spelled differently. **A `page.tsx` calls `readOverviewSearch`/`readTransactionSearch`/`readPublicReportSearch`**, which take Next's raw `searchParams` and do the picking and the parsing together, so each parameter is named in exactly one place. Spelling the two halves out per route instead is how `/p/[code]` once kept reading a renamed parameter: the parsers take `unknown`, so a wrong key is not a type error and zod strips it, and the filter silently did nothing on the server while the client honoured it.

Mutations invalidate rather than revalidate a path. The bare prefix covers every filter combination:

| Mutation | Invalidates |
|---|---|
| transactions | `["transactions"]`, `["overview"]` |
| Purposes | `["purposes"]`, `["transactions"]`, `["overview"]`, `["shareLinks"]` |
| Funding Sources | `["fundingSources"]`, `["transactions"]`, `["overview"]` |
| share links | `["shareLinks"]` |

Both dimensions reach into `["transactions"]` because their names render inside the transaction table, and into `["overview"]` because it rolls up by Purpose and splits by Funding Source. Purposes additionally reach into `["shareLinks"]` because a link's scope is a list of Purposes — the links screen renders their names, and deleting one detaches it from every link that named it. Funding Sources deliberately do **not**: a link's scope is one-dimensional (ADR-0002). The per-dimension list lives in `src/features/dimensions/dimension-copy.ts`. Sign-out has no session query to invalidate — it calls `queryClient.removeQueries()` (evict everything, since there's nothing narrower left to target), then `router.replace("/login")`, then `router.refresh()` to clear the App Router's own cached RSC payload so Back doesn't resurrect the dashboard.

### Auth

Single-admin JWT (HS256, 7-day expiry, `sub: "admin"`) in an httpOnly `session` cookie via `src/lib/auth.ts` (jose). Credentials from `ADMIN_USERNAME`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD`, secret from `AUTH_SECRET` (32+ chars).

Two distinct layers, and the distinction matters:

- **`readSession()` at the top of `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`** is a UX guard. It keeps signed-out visitors off the screen and, like the App Router's own re-fetch of a layout's RSC payload on client-side navigation, runs on every navigation too.
- **`requireAuth()`/`requireAuthForAction()` in `src/server/auth-guard.ts`** is the security boundary. A Server Action reference is a stable ID postable to *any* route regardless of which page rendered it — not just the calling page's own URL — so a path-based guard genuinely cannot be the real boundary. **Every private Server Action and Route Handler must carry its own check, no exceptions.** There are exactly three public surfaces: `login` (Server Action); the `/api/public-report` Route Handler (deliberately unauthenticated, backing `getPublicReport` for `/p/[code]` readers who never sign in); and `/api/health`, which cannot be authenticated because the caller that matters — Docker's `HEALTHCHECK`, running inside the container — has no cookie jar. It answers `{ ok: true }` and nothing else: no version, no database path, no config, since it is reachable through the public hostname like anything else behind the tunnel. Adding a fourth is a decision, not a detail.

`AUTH_SECRET` must be at least 32 characters and must not be the old `.env.example` sample; `assertAuthSecret()` runs from `src/instrumentation.node.ts` so a weak secret fails at startup rather than at the first login. `assertAdminCredentials()` runs beside it and refuses to boot with an empty `ADMIN_USERNAME`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` or a shipped-default password.

`login` is rate-limited per client: `src/lib/client-ip.ts` turns `CF-Connecting-IP` into a key (IPv6 by /64, nothing else read — see `docs/adr/0001-cloudflare-tunnel-ingress.md`), `src/lib/login-rate-limit.ts` holds the in-memory counters, and `src/server/request-ip.ts` is the only part that touches `headers()`. The limit runs before the input is parsed, so a malformed payload cannot skip it.

CSRF is layered per transport: Server Actions get Next's built-in Origin/Host check for free. Route Handler reads get an explicit one via `guardApiRequest()` in `src/server/http-auth.ts`, on top of the auth check.

### Database

SQLite via better-sqlite3 with Drizzle ORM (`src/lib/db/index.ts`). WAL mode + 5s busy timeout. `DATABASE_URL` defaults to `./data.db` if unset. The connection is opened lazily (`getSqlite()`/`getDrizzle()` behind a `Proxy`, so importing the module is free) and cached on `globalThis` as the standard `next dev` HMR-safe singleton idiom.

**Migrations:** Versioned SQL migrations in `drizzle/` are the source of truth. After editing `schema.ts`, run `pnpm run db:generate` and commit the migration. They apply automatically on server startup via `src/lib/db/migrate.ts`, called from `src/instrumentation.node.ts`, itself invoked via `src/instrumentation.ts`'s `register()` hook (Next's own instrumentation convention) — explicitly skipped during `NEXT_PHASE=phase-production-build`, so `next build` never opens the database (enforced directly by CI's and the Docker build's `test ! -f data.db` steps). `migrate.ts` auto-baselines pre-existing databases (created by the old `db:push` flow with no `__drizzle_migrations` ledger): it stamps them as applied up to the migration matching their current columns, so existing volumes upgrade in place without `table already exists` / `duplicate column` errors. **Every new migration needs a matching `SCHEMA_PROBES` entry** or legacy databases replay incorrectly. `pnpm run db:push` remains for quick local iteration only.

**Date handling:** `transactions.date` is an ISO string `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm`. Month filtering compares string prefixes — `fromMonth` uses `>= "${month}-01"`, `toMonth` uses `< nextMonthStart()` (see `nextMonthStart` in `queries.ts`). No `Date` math in SQL; lexicographic string ordering on ISO dates is the mechanism.

## Key Conventions

- **Path alias:** `@/*` maps to `src/*`
- **Vietnamese UI, via a catalog:** All user-facing text is in Vietnamese and lives in `messages/vi.json` (next-intl, *without* i18n routing — `src/i18n/request.ts` is the one place a request's locale is decided, and it is `"vi"` until a second language exists). Components call `useTranslations()` (Server Components may use it too, or `getTranslations()` when async); an ESLint `no-restricted-syntax` rule rejects Vietnamese in any string, template or JSX text under `src/` outside tests, and `src/lib/no-hardcoded-copy.test.ts` keeps that rule honest. It sees diacritics only, so an unaccented word ("Link", the chart's "Th.7") still has to be caught by eye. Keys are type-checked, and `pnpm run typecheck`'s `next typegen` generates `messages/vi.d.json.ts` (gitignored) so a missing ICU argument is a compile error too. Route Handler error bodies are English machine codes, not catalog entries — nothing displays them. Amounts are always VND; the locale only changes how they are written. Components format through `useFormatters()`, which binds `src/lib/format.ts`'s pure, locale-taking functions to the active locale and the catalog's words.
- **Responsive pattern:** `useMediaQuery` hook (`src/hooks/use-media-query.ts`) with `ResponsiveModal` — Dialog on desktop (md+), Drawer on mobile. Its `getServerSnapshot: () => false` means the server always renders the Drawer branch and desktop clients swap after hydration; that is a legitimate transition, not a mismatch.
- **Form pattern:** TanStack Form with `form.Field` render-props and the shared Zod schema on `validators.onSubmit`. Form values must be typed as the schema's **input** (`z.input<>`, e.g. `PurposeFormValues`), not its output — TanStack Form matches a Standard Schema invariantly and the two differ at every optional field. Server-side failures go to local state, not the form error map.
- **Table:** TanStack Table **v9**, where nothing is bundled by default — `src/features/transactions/table-features.ts` registers the features the table may use (`rowSortingFeature`, the sorted row model, and the `sortFns` names `getAutoSortFn()` can ask for), and an API that is missing is a feature that was not registered rather than one v9 removed. `ColumnDef` is generic over that feature set, so `columns.tsx` types against `TransactionTableFeatures`. The columns serve the dashboard only; the public report renders its own card list. Rows are virtualized and absolutely positioned, so column widths are declared in `transaction-data-table.tsx` rather than derived from content.
- **`export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` on the root layout is load-bearing.** `next build`'s static-generation attempt can execute a page's own data-fetching code *concurrently* with an ancestor layout's `cookies()` call, not strictly after it, so `cookies()` alone doesn't reliably stop a build from opening `data.db`. `force-dynamic` is checked per route segment before any component body runs and cascades to every nested layout/page — don't "simplify" it away. The same goes for turning on `cacheComponents`, which makes this export a compile error and has no config-level replacement; `docs/adr/0003-no-cache-components.md` records the spike and what would have to change first.
- **`loading.tsx` + `notFound()`/`redirect()` in the same segment is a real trap.** A `loading.tsx` makes Next start streaming (committing to a 200 status) before a deeper conditional `notFound()`/`redirect()` call can resolve, so the right UI can render with the wrong HTTP status. `/p/[code]` has no `loading.tsx` for this reason.
- **Build output:** `.next/standalone` (self-contained `server.js` + a minimal traced `node_modules`) + `.next/static` + `public/` + `drizzle/`. Next's output-file-tracing can miss a deep/computed `require()` path under pnpm's virtual store — hit twice so far (`better-sqlite3`'s prebuilds, `@swc/helpers`), both fixed via an explicit `outputFileTracingIncludes` glob in `next.config.ts`; worth knowing the pattern before a third instance. `TZ=Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` needs `apk add --no-cache tzdata` on the `node:26-alpine` runner stage — the env var alone silently does nothing.
- **Routes are unchecked strings, and this has bitten three times.** A `fetchJson("/api/...")` path in `query-options.ts`, a `destination:` in `next.config.ts`, and a URL parameter name inside a `page.tsx` are all plain strings that neither `tsc` nor ESLint validates, so each can outlive what it names while every gate stays green — and the failure is quiet (a client-only 404 that SSR hides, a 404 on the main nav tab, a filter that works on the client and not on the server). `src/lib/route-targets.test.ts` asserts the first two resolve to a real `route.ts`/`page.tsx`; the third is handled by naming each parameter once, in `search-params.ts`. Add to those guards rather than around them.
- **A component's rendered output needs a test that renders it.** A status-code smoke test walks past anything that renders but reads as gibberish — Base UI's `Select` resolves its trigger label from the Root's `items` prop, `itemToStringLabel`, or a `SelectValue` children function, and from *none* of the `<SelectItem>`s below it, so a select once showed a sentinel and then a raw uuid with nothing failing. Vitest runs two projects for this: `.test.ts` is server-side and gets the `react-server` condition (so `server-only` stays silent), `.test.tsx` renders components and must not (that condition makes `react-dom/server` throw on import).
- **Release process:** GitHub Flow. Release-Please creates version bump PRs. Docker images published to GHCR on tagged releases. The runtime image is ~347MB (down from 597MB before the Next.js migration).
